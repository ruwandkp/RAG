## Overview

This project provides comprehensive resources and guides on various aspects of building intelligent data-driven applications using LangChain. 

Below are the key components covered:
- Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG): Enhancing LLM responses by retrieving relevant documents from external datasets. 
- Chatbot: Creating a chatbot that answers queries using your documents' content instead of pre-trained information. It provides a comprehensive guide to implementing RAG and building a document-based chatbot.

This project focuses on: 
## Document Loading
- **Learn the Fundamentals**: Understand the basics of data loading.
- **Diverse Data Sources**: Discover over 80 unique loaders provided by LangChain to access a wide range of data sources, including audio and video.

## Document Splitting
- **Best Practices**: Learn the best practices and important considerations for effectively splitting data.

## Vector Stores and Embeddings
- **Concept of Embeddings**: Dive into the concept and importance of embeddings.
- **Vector Store Integrations**: Explore various vector store integrations within LangChain.

## Retrieval
- **Advanced Techniques**: Master advanced techniques for accessing and indexing data in the vector store.
- **Enhanced Retrieval**: Enable retrieval of the most relevant information beyond simple semantic queries.

## Question Answering
- **One-Pass Solution**: Build an efficient one-pass question-answering solution.

## Chat
